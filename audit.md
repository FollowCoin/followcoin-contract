## GithHub repository
  1. Some directories contain outdated files, like: contracts\_1 and tests\_1
  2. vs\_code directory should not be stored in repository
  3. .gitignore should be populated with proper data (like temporary files, IDEs directories etc.)
  4. Repository  should not contain **build** directory as it is generated after **truffle compile.** After removing **build** directory tests stop working. Iht seems that **build** directory contained some files that were not reflected by the code (that directory should be automatically generated by **truffle compile** command.
  5. File naming is not consistent i.e.: test/FollowCoin.js should be named test/testFollowCoin.js or test/FollowCoin.spec.js
  6. You should remove code that is not used and is not planned to be used

## JS
  1. Setup JavaScript/Solidity linters, such as eslint, advantages:
    1. keeping your code style consistent
    2. Spotting potential errors and bad patterns (duplicate variables, unreachable code or invalid regular expressions)
    3. Saving time (you might uncover a bug or two on early stages, before they even reach runtime)
on a side note: use prettier, it is a tool that will help you with formatting your code. You can run prettier from command line or use it at pre commit hook
  
  2. Add truffle as dependency and write scripts for it, so the developers won&#39;t need to install it globally
  
  3. Use ES Next features such as
- let and const instead of var for variable declarations
- function default parameters
- template literals
- async/await
- in most places arrow you can use arrow functions instead of function declaration

  4. Write DRY code:
- There are a lot of places where code is duplicated (we found 10^18 to be used ~20 times)
- functions ether and coin are identical
- come up with better variable names, b1 and b2 does say nothing to developers


  5. Script tags should be placed in head instead at the bottom of the body (add defer attribute to the tag)

  6. Missing properties in package.json: name and version.  A **package.json** must have:

- **&quot;name&quot;**
  - all lowercase
  - ne word, no spaces
  - dashes and underscores allowed
- **&quot;version&quot;**
  - in the form of **x.x.x**
  - follows semver spec. It's also good to have such fields as: author, license, contributors, description  and scripts. A **package.json** file:

- lists the packages that your project depends on.
- allows you to specify the versions of a package that your project can use using semantic versioning rules.
- makes your build reproducible, and therefore _much_ easier to share with other developers.

##Suggestions about contracts code:

1. Logic is very hardly visible in code. Only single contract inheritance is used which causes that main contract FollowCoin.sol has only 1 public function that doesn&#39;t tell much about logic. My suggestion is to use multiple inheritance where possible to avoid 6 elements long inheritance chain.

2. Tests seem to be only negative (are testing when functions should fail) but they should also be positive (test when function should pass)

3. Migration passed 5 arguments to contract while it expected for 0 arguments: should be fixed in this PR: [https://github.com/FollowCoin/followcoin-contract/pull/4](https://github.com/FollowCoin/followcoin-contract/pull/4)
